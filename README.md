## Summary

The Dashboard link will show you a full story and give you a full analysis on NYC Citibike Data Analysis. We are able to see the total number of rides for the month of August which is the busiest month. You are able to see the difference between weekend usage and weekday usage. Weekends being the heaviest bike utilizations. Rates can be predicted based on the locations from the Starting and Ending points as well as time. There are some instances that futher analysis or research is needed so as why are more males riding than females. What is causing females to not want to ride. Majority of rides last up to 45 minutes. 20 minutes is the highest peak between all users. There also should be research done on locations that have stations and are rarely used as this could be an area to save money and move other bikes to a heavy area.
